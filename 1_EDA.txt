A. To analyze the distribution of customer ages and their relationship with product purchase (ProdTaken), create a histogram or density plot for age distribution and use side-by-side boxplots or violin plots to compare age distributions between customers who purchased a product and those who did not.

B. To determine how the type of contact influences the likelihood of purchasing a travel product, use cross-tabulation or chi-square tests if the data is categorical. If the contact type is continuous, use grouped bar plots to compare the purchase rates across different contact types.

C. To identify a correlation between the city tier (citytier) and monthly income (monthly income) of customers, use scatterplots or compute the Pearson correlation coefficient.

D. To find the average duration of a pitch for customers who purchased a product versus those who did not, use independent samples t-test or calculate the mean durations with corresponding confidence intervals for both groups.

E. To analyze the distribution of occupation types among customers and determine if there is an occupation type more likely to purchase a travel product, use bar plots and conduct chi-square tests.

F. To determine if there are gender-based preferences for the type of product pitched (ProductPitched), use contingency tables and chi-square tests.

G. To analyze the relationship between the number of trips taken by a customer and their likelihood to purchase a new travel product, use scatterplots and compute the correlation coefficient or perform logistic regression.

H. To determine if having a passport correlates with a higher number of trips taken or a higher likelihood of purchasing a travel product, use correlation analysis and chi-square tests.

I. To analyze customer satisfaction with the pitch and its influence on product purchase, use scatterplots, boxplots, or logistic regression.

J. To analyze the impact of the number of children on travel product purchases among customers with children, use cross-tabulation or t-tests if the data allows.

K. To determine gender preferences for product types, use contingency tables and chi-square tests.

L. To analyze the impact of marital status on travel preferences and product purchases, use cross-tabulation or logistic regression.

M. To examine the relationship between the number of children visiting and the likelihood of purchasing a travel product, use contingency tables and chi-square tests.

N. To determine the influence of owning a car on travel decisions, use correlation analysis or t-tests to assess the relationship between owning a car (own car) and the number of trips taken (number of trips) or the type of travel product purchased.

O. To analyze how monthly income influences customers' choice of travel products and identify any preferred income levels, use cross-tabulation or chi-square tests, and consider creating stacked bar plots to visualize the distribution of product choices across different income levels.
